# Turborepo starter

This Turborepo starter is maintained by the Turborepo core team.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```

==================================================================================
This is the GPT explanation about the .github/workflows/ci_main.yml file code of
continuous integration on github of my project in monorepo with multiple services.
================================================================================== 

# üöÄ Deploy Whole Monorepo Workflow

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically build and push Docker images for all services in the monorepo.  
The workflow detects changes in specific directories and only rebuilds the services that were modified, ensuring efficient CI/CD.

---

## üìå Workflow Overview

- **Trigger**: Runs on every push to the `main` branch if files in `apps/**`, `packages/**`, or `docker/**` change.  
- **Jobs**:
  - Builds Docker images for **api-server**, **front-end**, **reverse-proxy**, and **build-server**.
  - Pushes the images to **Docker Hub** with two tags:
    - `latest`
    - Git commit SHA (`${{ github.sha }}`)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Checkout Code  
Uses `actions/checkout` to fetch the full repository, ensuring proper build context.

### 2. Docker Hub Login  
Logs in using **secrets**:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_PAT`

### 3. Buildx Setup  
Configures Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds.

### 4. Detect Changed Services  
Uses `dorny/paths-filter` to detect which services changed:
- **api-server** ‚Üí changes in `apps/api-server/**`, `packages/**`, or its Dockerfile.  
- **front-end** ‚Üí changes in `apps/front-end/**`, `packages/**`, or its Dockerfile.  
- **reverse-proxy** ‚Üí changes in `apps/reverse-proxy/**`, `packages/*-config/**`, or its Dockerfile.  
- **build-server** ‚Üí changes in `apps/build-server/**` or its Dockerfile.  

### 5. Build & Push Images  
If a service was changed, its Docker image is:
- Built using its corresponding `Dockerfile`.
- Passed the secret `DATABASE_URL` as a build argument.
- Pushed to Docker Hub:
